# Personal Project Portfolio

## Description

Starting from scratch, I built this page to be able to showcase what I've learned so far in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design. It also provides me a personalized platform to showcase my projects hosted in GitHub that can be shared with potential employers. 

This page uses flex-box, css-grid, and media-queries to provide a responsive page experience when viewing the portfolio. It is a continual work-in-progress and my hope is that it can be used to show my growth as a developer over the coming months and years.
